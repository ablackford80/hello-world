Hello Humanoids! 

Sorry a bit of Bobby The Brain Heenan overtook me there. Is Bobby Hennan still alive? I say that as a serious question, because I know he had health issues and cancers and stuff like that so I had to ask, is he still alive? 

Anyway about me, I'm kinda new to this but I work in github a lot at work but now that I'm getting more and more into the coding aspect of this I thought it was time to create my own personal github account, and so here I am. Thinking I may eventually take this private but for the time being I'm keeping everything open to the public.
